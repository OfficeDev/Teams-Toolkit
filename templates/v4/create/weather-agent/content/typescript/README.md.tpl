# Overview of the Weather Agent template

This agent template is built on top of [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/Agents).
It showcases a simple Weather Forecast Agent that is hosted on a express core web service. This Agent is configured to accept a request asking for information about a weather forecast and respond to the caller with an Adaptive Card.

This agent template is intended to introduce you the basics of integrating LangChain with the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK in order to build powerful Agents. It can also be used as a the base for a Custom Engine Agent that you choose to develop.

Note: This template requires JSON output from the model which works best from newer versions of the model such as gpt-4o-mini.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 22.
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli).
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - Prepare your own [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`.
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint>`, and deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-deployment>`.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your agent in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground`.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the agent.

**Congratulations**! You are running an agent that can now interact with users in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground.
